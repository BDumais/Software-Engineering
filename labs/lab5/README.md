Hello World, please read this readme. Reading the Readme is generally a good idea, because reading the readme not only allows you to read a file that wants to be read, but allows you to utilize your reading skills while reading a read me. Also it gives you information (like the benefits of reading the readme). Thanks for reading me, I am still a readme.
